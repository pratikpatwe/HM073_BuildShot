# Project Rules

## 🚀 Development Methodology
- **Agile & Quality-First**: We build fast but we don't ship broken code.

## 📝 Git Commit Rules
We use a strict prefix-based commit system. All messages must be lowercase and descriptive.

**Format**: `prefix: description`

### Available Prefixes:
- `feat:` Use for new features or significant logic updates.
- `fix:` Use for bug fixes or resolving errors.
- `ui:` Use for styling, layout, CSS, and component UI changes.
- `refactor:` Use for code cleanup or restructuring without changing behavior.
- `docs:` Use for updating documentation, README, or `rules.md`.
- `chore:` Use for package installs, configuration, or maintenance.
- `merge:` Use for manual merge resolution or branch syncs.
